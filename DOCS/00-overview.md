# Overview

solid.ai is the organizational nervous system for AI-native companies. It provides a holistic blueprint for connecting purpose, data, intelligence, automation, and organizational design into an ethical, adaptive ecosystem.

## Objectives

- Establish a shared language for human–AI collaboration.
- Offer reference models that teams can tailor to their own context.
- Provide governance guardrails that scale with experimentation.
- Enable continuous learning loops across strategy, delivery, and operations.

## Key Artifacts

- **Manifesto:** Anchors philosophy and roadmap.
- **Principles:** Codify ethical, human-centered decision making.
- **Architecture:** Shows how data, cognition, and automation interlock.
- **Playbooks:** Actionable guidance for squads, pools, and operations.
- **RFCs & ADRs:** Capture decisions that evolve the framework over time.

## How to Navigate the Repository

1. Start with the Manifesto for context and intent.
2. Read the numbered documents in `DOCS/` for a deep dive into each layer.
3. Explore Mermaid diagrams in `DIAGRAMS/` to visualize interactions.
4. Review RFCs and ADRs to understand how the framework evolves.
5. Apply the playbooks to bring concepts into operational practice.

## Versioning

- `main` holds stable releases of the framework.
- `dev` is the integration branch for approved RFCs.
- Manifesto updates follow semantic versioning (v1.0.0, v1.1.0, etc.).
