# Principles

solid.ai principles encode the behaviors required to build responsible, adaptive, AI-native organizations. They apply across strategy, design, and operations.

## Purpose-Led Decisions

- Anchor every automation or AI implementation in a human-centered purpose.
- Resist optimizing for efficiency at the expense of values or trust.

## Living Architecture

- Treat the organization as a living organism that learns and evolves.
- Prefer modular designs that can adapt without systemic collapse.

## Continuous Learning

- Capture feedback from every interaction—human or machine.
- Use data, retrospectives, and telemetry to drive iterative improvements.

## Intelligent Decentralization

- Empower teams at the edge with decision-making authority and transparent data.
- Maintain coherence through shared principles, playbooks, and guardrails.

## Cognitive Workforce

- Define explicit roles, responsibilities, and metrics for AI agents.
- Ensure accountability and traceability for automated decisions.

## Ethical Automation

- Make automations explainable, auditable, and observable by design.
- Balance automation throughput with human oversight and consent.

## Scalable Simplicity

- Strive for solutions that are simple to understand, extend, and govern.
- Let complexity emerge from interaction, not upfront design.

## Human–Machine Symbiosis

- Combine human empathy, creativity, and purpose with AI scale and precision.
- Foster collaboration rituals where humans and AI agents co-create value.
