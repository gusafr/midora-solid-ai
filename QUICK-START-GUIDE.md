## What is SOLID.AI?

SOLID.AI is an open framework for building **AI-native organizations** where humans and AI co-create value responsibly. It's not just about using AI—it's about designing your entire organization (strategy, data, intelligence, automation, and people) as a coherent, ethical, adaptive system.

### Core Idea in One Sentence
**Purpose-driven humans + well-defined AI agents + shared data + transparent governance = organizations that scale intelligently and ethically.**

---

## Why Should Your Team Care?

✅ **Stop treating AI as a bolt-on** — Integrate it systemically  
✅ **Reduce AI risks** — Built-in ethics, observability, and human oversight  
✅ **Empower teams** — Clear decision rights and autonomous squads  
✅ **Trust your data** — Shared contracts instead of data chaos  
✅ **Learn continuously** — Feedback loops in everything

## The 6 Layers of SOLID.AI (In 60 Seconds)

| Layer | What It Is | Why It Matters |
|-------|------------|----------------|
| **Purpose Layer** | Your mission, values, strategic intent | Keeps AI aligned with human goals |
| **Data Spine** | Shared data contracts and lineage | Everyone speaks the same data language |
| **Cognitive Layer** | AI agents with clear roles and guardrails | AI is transparent and accountable |
| **Automation Mesh** | Event-driven workflows (SIPOC patterns) | Work flows reliably at scale |
| **Organizational Layer** | Purpose-driven squads and pools | Teams are adaptive and empowered |
| **Governance & Ethics** | Oversight, transparency, auditability | Build trust, not regret |

## 10 Essential AI Prompts to Start Using Today

### 1. Before Building Any Feature
```
I'm about to build [FEATURE]. Before I start, help me answer:
1. What human need does this serve (not just metrics)?
2. How does it align with our mission?
3. What ethical risks exist?
4. What success metrics matter beyond "shipped"?
```

### 2. When Defining an AI Agent
```
Define an AI agent for [TASK]:
- Agent name and role
- Purpose (why it exists)
- Capabilities (what it can do)
- Guardrails (what it cannot do)
- Human oversight (when humans intervene)
- Success metrics (value, performance, ethics)

Format as YAML for our agent registry.
```

### 3. When Designing Data Contracts
```
Design a data contract for [ENTITY/EVENT]:
- Schema with semantic meaning
- Owner and SLA
- Quality expectations
- Privacy and security requirements
- Consuming systems

Generate in YAML format.
```

### 4. When Reviewing Code
```
Review this code for:
1. Functional correctness
2. Observability (logging, metrics, tracing)
3. Ethical implications (bias, privacy, transparency)
4. AI agent interaction patterns
5. Data contract compliance

[PASTE CODE]
```

### 5. When Prioritizing Work (Product)
```
Prioritize these initiatives using SOLID.AI principles:
[LIST INITIATIVES]

Evaluate on:
- Purpose alignment
- User value (real needs)
- Learning potential
- Ethical risk
- AI readiness
- Organizational capacity

Recommend priority order with rationale.
```

### 6. When Responding to Incidents (Operations)
```
We have a production incident: [DESCRIPTION].

Help me:
1. Triage severity
2. Identify root causes (code, data, AI, infrastructure)
3. Determine safe rollback or mitigation
4. Plan communication
5. Set up post-incident review

What's the first action?
```

### 7. When Running Retrospectives
```
Facilitate a retro for [TEAM/SPRINT/PROJECT].

Guide us through:
1. What happened (facts, metrics, sentiment)
2. Why it happened (through SOLID.AI lenses: purpose, AI collaboration, data, ethics)
3. What to do (continue, stop, start, learn)

Format as facilitation guide + action items.
```

### 8. When Facing Ethical Dilemmas
```
I'm facing an ethical decision about: [SITUATION].

Analyze through:
1. Stakeholder impact (users, team, society)
2. Values alignment
3. Transparency and explainability
4. Fairness and bias
5. Privacy and consent
6. Accountability
7. Long-term consequences

Recommend: Proceed / Proceed with changes / Do not proceed
```

### 9. When Forming a Squad
```
Draft a squad charter for [MISSION]:
- Purpose (why squad exists)
- Scope (what's in/out)
- Outcomes (success looks like)
- AI agents (which support this squad)
- Rituals (meetings, learning)
- Metrics (health and impact)
- Guardrails (constraints)

Format using SOLID.AI squad template.
```

### 10. When Planning a Release
```
Plan release of [FEATURE] with observability:
1. Rollout strategy (phased, canary, full)
2. Observability (what telemetry)
3. Success criteria (expand vs. rollback)
4. AI behavior monitoring
5. Human oversight plan
6. Feedback loops
7. Communication plan

Generate release checklist.
```

## The SOLID.AI Mindset (10 Principles)

1. **Purpose-Led Decisions** — Start with "why" before "how"
2. **Living Architecture** — Design systems that adapt and evolve
3. **Continuous Learning** — Build feedback loops everywhere
4. **Intelligent Decentralization** — Empower teams at the edge
5. **Cognitive Workforce** — Define clear roles for AI agents
6. **Ethical Automation** — Make AI explainable and auditable
7. **Scalable Simplicity** — Keep core concepts simple, let complexity emerge
8. **Human-Machine Symbiosis** — Combine human creativity with AI scale
9. **Data as a Shared Language** — Trustworthy contracts, not data silos
10. **Governance as Enabler** — Oversight that builds trust, not bureaucracy

## Common Questions

**Q: Is this only for big tech companies?**  
**A:** No! SOLID.AI scales from startups to enterprises. Start small (e.g., one AI agent with clear guardrails) and grow organically.

**Q: Do we need to adopt everything at once?**  
**A:** Absolutely not. Pick one layer (e.g., define your first AI agent properly) and expand from there.

**Q: What if we don't have AI yet?**  
**A:** Perfect timing! Use SOLID.AI principles to design AI responsibly from the start. The organizational and data spine layers apply even without AI.

**Q: Is this compatible with our existing frameworks (Scrum, SAFe, etc.)?**  
**A:** Yes. SOLID.AI is designed to complement, not replace, existing methods. Think of it as a meta-framework for AI-native operations.

**Q: How do we measure success?**  
**A:** Look for: clearer purpose alignment, faster time to value, better AI accountability, higher trust (internal and external), and continuous learning culture.
