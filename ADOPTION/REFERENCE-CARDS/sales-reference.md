## 🚀 10 Essential AI Prompts for Sales

### 1. **Personalized Outreach Email**

**Use when:** Reaching out to a new prospect

**Prompt:**
```
I'm reaching out to [Prospect Name], [Title] at [Company], who works in [Industry].

Their company recently [news/trigger event, e.g., "announced expansion into Europe"].

Our product [brief value prop, e.g., "helps sales teams automate pipeline forecasting"].

Draft a personalized outreach email that:
- References their recent news naturally
- Highlights 1-2 specific pain points they likely face
- Proposes a 15-minute discovery call
- Keeps tone conversational, not salesy
- Max 120 words

Do NOT use:
- Generic "I hope this email finds you well"
- Aggressive urgency tactics
- Multiple asks (just one call-to-action)
```

**Why it works:** Specificity prevents generic templates; constraints ensure respectful, focused messaging.

---

### 2. **Objection Handling Strategy**

**Use when:** Prospect raises common objections (price, timing, competition)

**Prompt:**
```
Prospect objection: "[exact quote, e.g., 'Your pricing is 30% higher than Competitor X']"

Context:
- Our differentiators: [list 2-3 unique value props]
- Their situation: [company size, pain points, goals]
- Stage: [Discovery/Demo/Proposal/Negotiation]

Provide:
1. Root cause: Why they're raising this (price sensitivity, budget constraints, or comparison shopping?)
2. Response framework: How to address empathetically without immediately discounting
3. Three potential responses (direct answer, reframe value, ask clarifying question)
4. Next steps to de-risk and advance the deal

Format as a conversational script I can adapt.
```

**Why it works:** Helps you think strategically, not react defensively; builds objection-handling muscle.

---

### 3. **Competitive Battle Card**

**Use when:** Competing against a specific vendor

**Prompt:**
```
We're competing against [Competitor Name] for a deal at [Company/Industry].

What we know about competitor:
- [Pricing model, strengths, weaknesses]

Our strengths:
- [list 2-3 differentiators]

Generate a competitive battle card with:
1. Head-to-head feature comparison (where we win, where they win)
2. Common objections prospects raise when comparing us
3. Discovery questions to uncover fit gaps with competitor
4. Positioning statements to differentiate without badmouthing
5. Case study/proof point to reinforce our strengths

Keep it factual and respectful (no false claims or trash talk).
```

**Why it works:** Prepares you to compete on value, not price; builds confidence in differentiation.

---

### 4. **Discovery Call Prep**

**Use when:** Preparing for initial discovery call with a prospect

**Prompt:**
```
I have a discovery call tomorrow with [Prospect Name], [Title] at [Company].

Research I've done:
- [Company info: size, industry, recent news]
- [Prospect info: LinkedIn background, role, tenure]

Our solution: [1-sentence value prop]

Generate:
1. **Opening** (30 seconds): How to introduce myself and set agenda
2. **Discovery questions** (10 questions): Mix of business pain, technical fit, decision process, timeline
3. **Qualification criteria**: How to assess if this is a good-fit opportunity (BANT: Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline)
4. **Next steps**: What to propose if call goes well
5. **Red flags**: What signals indicate this won't close (e.g., no budget, no urgency)

Format as a call script with time boxes (5 min intro, 20 min discovery, 5 min next steps).
```

**Why it works:** Structured approach ensures you ask the right questions; reduces "wing it" risk.

---

### 5. **Follow-Up Sequencing**

**Use when:** Planning post-meeting follow-up to keep deal moving

**Prompt:**
```
After a [Discovery/Demo/Proposal] call with [Prospect Name], they said:
- "[key takeaway, e.g., 'We need to discuss internally']"
- Next step: [what they committed to, e.g., "Share with CFO, get back next week"]

Generate a 3-touch follow-up sequence:
1. **Day 1** (same day): Thank-you email summarizing call, attaching resources
2. **Day 5** (if no response): Gentle nudge, add value (case study, relevant article)
3. **Day 10** (if still no response): Final check-in, ask if timing changed

Tone: Helpful, not pushy. Provide value in each touch, not just "checking in."

Each email max 100 words.
```

**Why it works:** Systematic follow-up prevents deals from going dark; adds value, not pressure.

---

### 6. **Deal Risk Assessment**

**Use when:** Evaluating if a deal is at risk of slipping or losing

**Prompt:**
```
Deal status:
- **Opportunity:** [Company name, deal size, close date]
- **Stage:** [Discovery/Demo/Proposal/Negotiation]
- **Champion:** [Name, title, engagement level]
- **Last activity:** [Date of last meaningful interaction]
- **Red flags:** [e.g., "Haven't met economic buyer", "No response to proposal for 2 weeks"]

Assess:
1. **Risk level** (Low/Medium/High) and reasoning
2. **Root cause**: Why is this deal at risk?
3. **Action plan**: 3 specific steps to de-risk (e.g., engage executive sponsor, revisit timeline, validate budget)
4. **Escalation**: Should I involve my manager or a senior executive?

Be brutally honest about risk (I'd rather know now than be surprised later).
```

**Why it works:** Forces objective evaluation; proactive intervention saves deals.

---

### 7. **Proposal Value Narrative**

**Use when:** Writing executive summary for proposal or business case

**Prompt:**
```
Prospect: [Company name, industry]
Pain points they shared:
- [Pain 1]
- [Pain 2]
- [Pain 3]

Our solution addresses these by:
- [Capability 1 → Pain 1]
- [Capability 2 → Pain 2]
- [Capability 3 → Pain 3]

Expected outcomes:
- [Metric 1, e.g., "Reduce manual work by 20 hours/week"]
- [Metric 2, e.g., "Improve forecast accuracy to 85%"]

Draft a compelling executive summary (max 250 words) that:
1. Opens with their business challenge (not our product)
2. Connects our solution to their specific pains
3. Quantifies expected value/ROI
4. Ends with clear next step (e.g., "Let's schedule a kick-off call")

Tone: Confident but not arrogant; customer-centric, not product-centric.
```

**Why it works:** Buyer-focused narrative resonates better than feature list; ROI drives decisions.

---

### 8. **Pipeline Forecasting Input**

**Use when:** Updating forecast for weekly pipeline review

**Prompt:**
```
I'm forecasting this quarter's pipeline. Review my deals and flag any I should adjust:

**Commit:**
- [Deal 1]: $50K, close date [date], stage Negotiation, champion engaged, contract in legal review
- [Deal 2]: $30K, close date [date], stage Proposal, verbal yes, waiting on signature

**Best Case:**
- [Deal 3]: $40K, close date [date], stage Demo, positive feedback, but no budget confirmed
- [Deal 4]: $60K, close date [date], stage Discovery, early stage, long sales cycle

For each deal, assess:
1. Should it be in Commit/Best Case/Pipeline based on evidence?
2. What's missing to confidently forecast (e.g., "No economic buyer engaged")?
3. Recommended actions to increase confidence or move to Commit

Help me avoid sandbagging (too conservative) or happy-earing (too optimistic).
```

**Why it works:** Objective review reduces forecast bias; identifies gaps to address.

---

### 9. **Customer Success Handoff**

**Use when:** Transitioning closed deal to customer success/account management

**Prompt:**
```
Just closed a deal with [Company name]!

Deal details:
- **Contract value:** $X
- **Products/services:** [list]
- **Key stakeholders:** [names, titles]
- **Pain points they're solving:** [list]
- **Success criteria they mentioned:** [e.g., "Go live in 60 days", "Achieve X% efficiency gain"]
- **Concerns/risks:** [e.g., "Tight timeline", "Change management challenge"]

Draft a handoff document for the customer success team covering:
1. **Account overview**: Who they are, why they bought
2. **Implementation priorities**: What to focus on first
3. **Stakeholder map**: Who to engage (champion, exec sponsor, end users)
4. **Success milestones**: 30/60/90-day goals
5. **Risk factors**: What could derail adoption (and how to mitigate)

Make it actionable, not just a data dump.
```

**Why it works:** Smooth handoff ensures customer value realization; prevents "sales promises, delivery disappoints."

---

### 10. **Win/Loss Analysis**

**Use when:** Reflecting on why you won or lost a deal (for continuous improvement)

**Prompt:**
```
Deal outcome: [Won/Lost]
Competitor (if lost): [Name or "No decision"]

**Deal details:**
- Company, size, industry
- Why they were evaluating (pain points)
- Our strengths and weaknesses in their eyes
- Key decision criteria (price, features, relationship, timing)

**Outcome:**
- [If won]: Why did we win? What did we do well?
- [If lost]: Why did we lose? What could we have done differently?

Generate:
1. **Key learnings**: 3 takeaways for future deals
2. **Process improvements**: What should we change (e.g., "Engage exec sponsor earlier")?
3. **Messaging adjustments**: Did our value prop resonate? Any objections we couldn't overcome?
4. **Competitive intel** (if applicable): What did competitor do better/worse?

Be specific and actionable (not "work harder" or vague platitudes).
```

**Why it works:** Structured reflection builds winning patterns; prevents repeating mistakes.

## 💡 Pro Tips for AI-Assisted Selling

### DO:
- ✅ **Personalize prompts**: More context = better output (company, industry, pain points)
- ✅ **Review and edit**: AI drafts first, you refine for authenticity and accuracy
- ✅ **Iterate**: If output isn't great, refine your prompt and try again
- ✅ **Use constraints**: "Max 120 words", "Conversational tone", "No buzzwords"
- ✅ **Learn from wins**: Feed successful emails/calls back to AI to replicate patterns

### DON'T:
- ❌ **Copy-paste blindly**: AI doesn't know your prospect's nuances; always review
- ❌ **Lose your voice**: Edit to sound like YOU, not a robot
- ❌ **Make false claims**: AI might hallucinate features or case studies; fact-check
- ❌ **Spam**: Just because AI can generate 100 emails doesn't mean you should send them all
- ❌ **Ignore ethics**: Respectful, consent-based outreach always

## 🎓 Advanced Techniques

### **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**
Ask AI to "think step-by-step" for complex scenarios:
```
"Walk me through how to rescue this stalled deal. First, diagnose why it stalled. Second, identify who to engage. Third, draft a re-engagement plan."
```

### **Role-Playing**
Have AI play the prospect for objection practice:
```
"Act as a skeptical CFO who thinks our product is too expensive. I'll pitch, you object, I'll respond. Let's go 3 rounds."
```

### **Persona-Based Drafting**
Specify tone/style:
```
"Write this email as if you're a trusted advisor (not a salesperson). Warm, knowledgeable, no jargon."
```
