## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Training without application** - Theory with no hands-on practice  
✅ **Solution:** Every module includes real work project

❌ **One-size-fits-all content** - Generic training for all functions  
✅ **Solution:** Function-specific Level 2+ paths

❌ **Launch and forget** - No continuous learning  
✅ **Solution:** Learning sprints, Guild, monthly new tools

❌ **No incentives** - Expecting voluntary participation  
✅ **Solution:** Certification ladder with salary bumps

❌ **No metrics** - Can't measure impact  
✅ **Solution:** Track adoption, effectiveness, quality, innovation
