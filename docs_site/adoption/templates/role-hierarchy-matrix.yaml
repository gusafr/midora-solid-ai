     - Replace placeholder data (company name, employee count, AI agents)
     - Add/remove roles based on your structure
     - Adjust compensation ranges based on geography, industry

  2. **Map All Roles (Humans + AI):**
     - For each role, define: tasks, autonomy, decision authority, escalation rules, compensation
     - Use this template to create clarity on "who decides what"

  3. **Define Career Paths:**
     - For humans: What does it take to get promoted to next level?
     - For AI agents: When to upgrade to next level (e.g., Low → Intermediate)?

  4. **Align Compensation:**
     - Ensure salary ranges match level (Low: $40K-$60K, Intermediate: $70K-$120K, High: $150K-$250K, Executive: $200K+)
     - Ensure AI agent costs reasonable (Low: $200-$500/mo, Intermediate: $1K-$3K/mo)

  5. **Communicate to Team:**
     - Share this matrix with all employees
     - Use in 1:1s: "Here's your current level, here's how to get to next level"
     - Use in AI agent deployment: "This AI agent is Low-Level, it escalates to Intermediate humans"

  6. **Review Quarterly:**
     - Update roles as organization evolves
     - Promote employees who've met next-level requirements
     - Upgrade AI agents that are ready for next level
