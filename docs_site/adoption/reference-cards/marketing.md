## 🚀 10 Essential AI Prompts for Marketing

### 1. **Blog Post Outline & First Draft**

**Use when:** Creating thought leadership or educational content

**Prompt:**
```
Topic: [e.g., "How AI is transforming sales forecasting"]
Target audience: [e.g., "VP Sales at B2B SaaS companies, 100-500 employees"]
Keywords: [e.g., "sales forecasting, AI, pipeline management"]
Goal: [e.g., "Educate on AI benefits, generate demo requests"]

Generate:
1. **SEO-optimized headline** (3 options, max 60 characters)
2. **Outline** (Introduction, 3-5 main sections, Conclusion, CTA)
3. **First draft** (1200 words):
   - Hook: Start with surprising stat or customer pain point
   - Body: Practical advice, examples, avoid jargon
   - Conclusion: Summarize key takeaways
   - CTA: Invite to [e.g., "Download our forecasting guide"]

Tone: [e.g., "Conversational expert, helpful not salesy"]

Do NOT:
- Make unverified claims (I'll fact-check)
- Use clichés ("In today's fast-paced world...")
- Over-promote our product (educate first, sell second)
```

**Why it works:** Structured approach speeds drafting; human editor refines for brand voice and accuracy.

---

### 2. **Social Media Content Calendar**

**Use when:** Planning a month of social posts across platforms

**Prompt:**
```
Campaign: [e.g., "Product launch for new AI feature"]
Duration: [e.g., "4 weeks"]
Platforms: [LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram]
Audience: [e.g., "Marketing leaders, tech-savvy SMBs"]

Generate a 4-week content calendar with:
- **Week 1** (Awareness): Teaser posts, problem/pain point focus
- **Week 2** (Education): How our solution works, use cases, demos
- **Week 3** (Proof): Customer testimonials, case studies, ROI stats
- **Week 4** (Action): Launch day, limited-time offer, CTAs

For each post:
- Platform-optimized copy (LinkedIn: 150 words, Twitter: 280 chars, Instagram: visual + caption)
- Suggested visual (image, video, carousel)
- Hashtags (3-5 relevant, not overstuffed)
- Best posting time (based on audience)

Mix formats: 50% educational, 30% promotional, 20% engaging (polls, questions).
```

**Why it works:** Cohesive narrative across platforms; balances value-add with promotion.

---

### 3. **Email Campaign A/B Test Ideas**

**Use when:** Optimizing email open and click rates

**Prompt:**
```
Email campaign: [e.g., "Webinar invitation"]
Current subject line: [e.g., "Join our webinar on AI in sales"]
Current body: [brief summary]

Generate 5 A/B test variations for:
1. **Subject lines** (test urgency, personalization, curiosity, benefit-focused, question-based)
   - Example: "❌ This: 'Webinar on AI' ✅ Test: 'How top sales teams use AI to close 30% more deals'"
2. **CTAs** (test wording, color, placement)
   - Example: "Register Now" vs. "Save My Spot" vs. "Learn More"
3. **Email length** (short 100 words vs. medium 250 words)
4. **Personalization depth** (generic vs. "Hi [Name], since you downloaded [Resource]...")

For each test:
- Hypothesis: What are we testing and why?
- Success metric: Open rate, click rate, or conversion rate?
- Sample size needed: How many sends to detect 10% lift?

Prioritize tests by potential impact and ease of implementation.
```

**Why it works:** Systematic testing beats guessing; learns what resonates with your audience.

### 4. **Competitive Positioning Statement**

**Use when:** Differentiating your product in crowded market

**Prompt:**
```
Our product: [Brief description, e.g., "AI-powered sales forecasting tool"]

Competitors:
- [Competitor 1]: [Their positioning, e.g., "Enterprise-grade, complex setup"]
- [Competitor 2]: [Their positioning, e.g., "Budget-friendly, limited features"]

Our unique strengths:
- [Strength 1, e.g., "Works out-of-the-box with all major CRMs"]
- [Strength 2, e.g., "Explainable AI (not black box)"]
- [Strength 3, e.g., "Mid-market pricing"]

Target customer pain points:
- [Pain 1, e.g., "Current forecasting is manual and inaccurate"]
- [Pain 2, e.g., "Existing tools too complex for small team"]

Generate:
1. **Positioning statement** (2 sentences): "For [target customer] who [pain point], [our product] is a [category] that [unique benefit]. Unlike [competitor], we [key differentiator]."
2. **Elevator pitch** (30 seconds / 75 words)
3. **Homepage hero headline** (10 words max, benefit-focused)
4. **Tag line** (5 words, memorable)

Avoid:
- Jargon ("synergize", "leverage", "disrupt")
- Generic claims ("best-in-class", "innovative")
- Badmouthing competitors
```

**Why it works:** Clarity on differentiation guides all messaging; resonates with target buyers.

---

### 5. **Customer Journey Mapping**

**Use when:** Understanding touchpoints from awareness to advocacy

**Prompt:**
```
Product: [e.g., "B2B SaaS project management tool"]
Buyer persona: [e.g., "Head of Operations at 50-200 person company"]

Map the customer journey across 5 stages:
1. **Awareness**: How do they first learn about us? (Google search, referral, ad, event)
2. **Consideration**: What content do they consume? (blog, case study, demo, pricing page)
3. **Decision**: What tips them to buy? (free trial, sales call, ROI calculator, peer review)
4. **Onboarding**: First 30 days as customer (setup, training, early wins)
5. **Advocacy**: What makes them refer others or renew? (success outcomes, community, support)

For each stage:
- Customer mindset/questions (e.g., "Do I need this?" → "Is it worth the cost?" → "Will it work for us?")
- Marketing touchpoints (content, channels, offers)
- Success metric (e.g., Awareness: website traffic; Decision: trial-to-paid conversion)
- Drop-off risks (e.g., "Trial users don't activate feature X")

Identify gaps: Where are we losing prospects? What content/touchpoints are missing?
```

**Why it works:** Reveals where to focus marketing efforts; identifies conversion bottlenecks.

---

### 6. **Campaign Performance Post-Mortem**

**Use when:** Learning from completed campaign (win or fail)

**Prompt:**
```
Campaign: [e.g., "Q4 product launch campaign"]
Goal: [e.g., "Generate 500 signups in 30 days"]

Results:
- Signups: [Actual vs. goal]
- Spend: $[amount]
- Channels: [e.g., "Google Ads, LinkedIn, Email, Webinar"]
- Top performers: [e.g., "LinkedIn ads: 200 signups, $50 CPA"]
- Underperformers: [e.g., "Google Ads: 50 signups, $150 CPA"]

Analyze:
1. **What worked well?** (channels, messaging, creative, timing)
2. **What underperformed?** (root cause: targeting, creative, offer, budget allocation)
3. **Surprises**: Did anything unexpected happen (viral post, competitor reaction)?
4. **Key learnings**: 3-5 takeaways for future campaigns
5. **Action items**: What to do differently next time (e.g., "Shift 50% of budget from Google to LinkedIn")

Be honest about failures (we learn more from them than successes).
```

**Why it works:** Continuous improvement loop; builds institutional knowledge.

---

### 7. **Customer Testimonial Story Mining**

**Use when:** Turning customer success into compelling narratives

**Prompt:**
```
Customer: [Company name, industry, size]
Challenge they faced: [e.g., "Manual sales forecasting took 10 hours/week, only 60% accurate"]
Our solution: [e.g., "Implemented our AI forecasting tool"]
Outcome: [e.g., "Forecasting now takes 30 min/week, 90% accurate, won $2M deal they would have missed"]

Transform this into:
1. **Case study structure** (Problem → Solution → Results):
   - Headline (10 words, outcome-focused)
   - Challenge (2 paragraphs, empathize with pain)
   - Solution (1 paragraph, how we helped)
   - Results (bullet points with metrics)
   - Quote from customer (1-2 sentences)
2. **Social proof snippet** (for website, 50 words)
3. **Tweet-sized testimonial** (280 characters)
4. **Video script** (90 seconds, customer interview format)

Make it relatable: Focus on customer's story, not our product features.
```

**Why it works:** Real customer stories build trust; specific metrics prove value.

---

### 8. **Content Repurposing Strategy**

**Use when:** Maximizing ROI from existing content

**Prompt:**
```
Original content: [e.g., "60-minute webinar on AI sales automation"]

Audience insights:
- Some prefer reading (blog), others watching (video), others quick hits (social)
- Attention spans vary (long-form vs. snackable)

Repurpose this into:
1. **Blog post** (1500 words, key takeaways + screenshots)
2. **LinkedIn carousel** (10 slides, visual summary)
3. **Twitter thread** (8 tweets, bite-sized insights)
4. **Email nurture series** (3 emails, each covering 1 section of webinar)
5. **Short video clips** (5x 60-second highlight clips for social)
6. **Infographic** (visual summary of stats/frameworks)
7. **Podcast episode** (audio-only version for commuters)

For each format:
- Key message to emphasize
- Platform best practices (tone, length, visuals)
- CTA tailored to format (e.g., blog → download guide; Twitter → reply with questions)

Goal: 10x content reach with minimal additional effort.
```

**Why it works:** One piece of content → 7+ assets; meets audience where they are.

---

### 9. **Sentiment Analysis Briefing**

**Use when:** Understanding how customers feel about your brand

**Prompt:**
```
Brand mentions data:
- Source: [e.g., "Social media (Twitter, LinkedIn), review sites (G2, Capterra), support tickets"]
- Volume: [e.g., "500 mentions last month"]
- Sample mentions:
  - "[Positive mention, e.g., 'Love the new AI feature!']"
  - "[Negative mention, e.g., 'Pricing is too high for small teams']"
  - "[Neutral mention, e.g., 'Tried the demo, still evaluating']"

Analyze:
1. **Overall sentiment**: X% positive, Y% neutral, Z% negative
2. **Top themes**:
   - Positive: [e.g., "Ease of use (100 mentions)", "Great support (80 mentions)"]
   - Negative: [e.g., "Pricing (50 mentions)", "Missing integrations (30 mentions)"]
3. **Trending topics**: What's spiking this month vs. last?
4. **Risk alerts**: Any PR crises or viral complaints?
5. **Opportunities**: What are customers asking for (feature requests, content topics)?

Provide actionable recommendations:
- Marketing: Address pricing objections in messaging
- Product: Prioritize [integration X] on roadmap
- Support: Create FAQ on [common issue]
```

**Why it works:** Data-driven understanding of brand health; informs product and messaging.

---

### 10. **Landing Page Copy Optimization**

**Use when:** Improving conversion rate on key pages

**Prompt:**
```
Landing page: [URL or description, e.g., "Product demo request page"]

Current performance:
- Traffic: [X visitors/month]
- Conversion rate: [Y%, e.g., "2%"]
- Goal: [e.g., "Increase to 4%"]

Current copy:
- Headline: [e.g., "See how our tool works"]
- Subheadline: [e.g., "Schedule a demo with our team"]
- Body: [key points]
- CTA: [e.g., "Request Demo"]

Optimize for:
1. **Headline clarity**: Does it immediately communicate value? (not just feature)
   - ❌ Weak: "See our tool"
   - ✅ Strong: "Boost sales forecast accuracy by 30% in 30 days"
2. **Benefit-focused subhead**: What's in it for visitor?
3. **Social proof**: Add testimonial, logo bar, or stat (e.g., "Join 1,000+ sales teams")
4. **CTA friction reduction**: Change wording or form length
   - Test: "Request Demo" vs. "See It in Action" vs. "Get Started Free"
5. **Visual hierarchy**: What to emphasize (larger text, bold, color)

Provide 3 variations to A/B test.
```

**Why it works:** Small copy tweaks can 2x conversion; testing validates assumptions.

## 💡 Pro Tips for AI-Assisted Marketing

### DO:
- ✅ **Provide brand voice examples**: "Write like [brand], which is [tone adjectives]"
- ✅ **Iterate on outputs**: First draft rarely perfect; refine prompts and regenerate
- ✅ **Use constraints**: "Max 280 characters", "Include 3 stats", "Conversational tone"
- ✅ **Test variations**: AI can generate 10 headline options fast; test top 3
- ✅ **Fact-check**: AI might hallucinate stats or customer names; always verify

### DON'T:
- ❌ **Publish unedited**: AI doesn't know your brand nuances; always human-review
- ❌ **Lose creativity**: Use AI for first drafts, humans add storytelling and spark
- ❌ **Plagiarize**: AI might rehash existing content; ensure originality
- ❌ **Ignore analytics**: AI suggests, data validates; measure what works
- ❌ **Spam content**: Volume ≠ value; publish less, higher-quality content

## 🎓 Advanced Techniques

### **Persona-Based Writing**
Tailor tone to audience:

```
"Generate: 1) Tweet (280 char), 2) LinkedIn post (200 words), 3) Email subject line from this key message: [...]"
```

Feed AI your best content:
```
"Here are 3 blog posts in our brand voice [paste]. Now write a new post on [topic] matching this style."
