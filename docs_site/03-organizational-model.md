# Organizational Model

solid.ai organizes humans and AI agents into adaptive structures optimized for co-creation, learning, and resilience.

## Structural Elements

- **Squads:** Cross-functional units focused on delivering customer or stakeholder outcomes.
- **Pools:** Shared capability hubs (e.g., Data, AI Ops, Design) that provide expertise on demand.
- **Cognitive Agents:** AI teammates embedded in squads or pools with defined responsibilities.
- **Governance Circle:** Multi-disciplinary group that reviews ethics, observability, and compliance.

## Operating Rhythm

| Cadence | Activity | Participants |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Weekly | Outcome review & adaptive planning | Squad leads, embedded agents |
| Biweekly | Governance sync | Governance Circle members, compliance officers |
| Monthly | Portfolio alignment | Executive sponsors, pool leads |
| Quarterly | Strategy iteration & manifesto review | Leadership council |

## Decision Flows

1. Squads identify opportunities and produce RFC drafts.
2. Pools validate feasibility, data readiness, and AI agent design.
3. Governance Circle assesses ethical impact and observability requirements.
4. Approved RFCs trigger updates to playbooks, automation flows, and documentation.

## Roles & Responsibilities

- **Human Lead:** Maintains purpose alignment and stakeholder engagement.
- **AI Orchestrator:** Automates data gathering, summarization, and decision support.
- **Ops Steward:** Ensures compliance, telemetry, and incident response readiness.
- **Learning Curator:** Synthesizes feedback, publishes retrospectives, updates knowledge bases.

## Talent Development

- Promote rotational programs between squads and pools to diffuse expertise.
- Provide AI literacy training and ethical decision-making workshops.
- Encourage shared ownership of AI-assisted deliverables.

## Change Management

- Major structural shifts require RFC approval.
- ADRs document tooling and platform choices that impact organizational behavior.
- Retired structures should leave a knowledge trail in playbooks and docs.
