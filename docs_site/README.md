## 🚀 Quick Start (5 minutes)

**New to SOLID.AI?** Start here to understand the "why" and "what":

1. **[Quick Start Guide](../QUICK-START-GUIDE.md)** — 5-minute introduction + 10 essential AI prompts
2. **[Overview](00-overview.md)** — Framework introduction and transformation imperative

**Quick Summary:**
- SOLID.AI is an organizational operating system for companies where humans and AI co-create value
- Solves the "bipolar organization" problem: IT operates at AI speed, business operates at manual speed
- 6 layers: Purpose → Data Spine → Cognitive → Automation → Organizational → Governance
- Economics: 80% less overhead, 10x faster, exponential scalability, <1% error rates

## 📚 Foundational Understanding (2 hours)

**Goal:** Understand the strategic value and core architecture of SOLID.AI

**Recommended Path:**

1. **[Overview](00-overview.md)** (15 min) — What is SOLID.AI? Why does it matter?
2. **[Whole-Organization Transformation](09-whole-organization-transformation.md)** (30 min) — The bipolar organization problem, economics of AI-as-workforce, competitive imperative
3. **[Principles](01-principles.md)** (20 min) — 8 foundational principles that govern the framework
4. **[Architecture](02-architecture.md)** (30 min) — 6-layer architecture (Purpose, Data Spine, Cognitive, Automation, Organizational, Governance)
5. **[Human-AI Collaboration](08-human-ai-collaboration.md)** (25 min) — Where humans lead, where AI supports, design principles

**Key Takeaways:**
- Coherence across all functions (not just IT) is the only sustainable competitive advantage
- AI reduces overhead (80%→20% busywork), increases reliability (5-10%→<1% errors), enables exponential scale
- 4-level role hierarchy applies to both humans and AI agents (Assistant → Consultant → Specialist → Director)
- Humans lead in empathy, creative vision, ethical judgment, and physical presence; AI augments with data, automation, and consistency

## 🏗️ Implementation Path (8 hours)

**Goal:** Learn how to design, deploy, and operate an AI-Native organization

**Recommended Path:**

1. **[Human-AI Collaboration](08-human-ai-collaboration.md)** (30 min) — Design for augmentation, not replacement

3. **[AI Agents](05-ai-agents.md)** (60 min) — How to define agents (identity, capabilities, guardrails, oversight, metrics)
4. **[Organizational Model](03-organizational-model.md)** (60 min) — Squads, pools, MIDORA topology, adaptive scaling
5. **[AI-Native Agile](11-ai-native-agile.md)** (90 min) — Integrate AI with Scrum/SAFe (ceremonies, value stream, Portfolio/Program/Team)
6. **[Governance & Ethics](06-governance-ethics.md)** (60 min) — Accountability, transparency, compliance, ethical frameworks
7. **[Observability](07-observability.md)** (45 min) — Monitoring, metrics, telemetry, alerting for humans and AI
8. **[Automation SIPOC](04-automation-sipoc.md)** (45 min) — Workflow patterns, event-driven architecture, SIPOC mapping

**Key Takeaways:**
- Define AI agents like teammates: identity, capabilities, guardrails, human oversight, success metrics
- Squads are cross-functional (3-7 humans + AI agents), pools provide shared services
- AI-Native Agile: 64% faster delivery (17 weeks → 6 weeks), 70% less coordination overhead
- Governance is not optional: every AI agent must have clear accountability, transparency, and observability
