# SOLID.AI

**Strategic Organization Leveraging Intelligent Design for Artificial Intelligence**

---

## Overview

SOLID.AI is an open-source framework for designing intelligent, ethical, and adaptive organizations where humans and AI agents collaborate as peers. This comprehensive system addresses the "bipolar organization" challenge—where IT operates at digital speed while business functions remain analog—through a six-layer architecture enabling whole-organization transformation.
