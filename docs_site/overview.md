# Overview

solid.ai is the organizational nervous system for AI-native companies. It provides a holistic blueprint for connecting purpose, data, intelligence, automation, and organizational design into an ethical, adaptive ecosystem.

## The Transformation Imperative

**You cannot be "agile" or "AI-Native" when only IT operates in this paradigm.**

Most organizations attempting "digital transformation" create a **bipolar company**:
- ✅ **IT**: Agile squads, CI/CD, AI-assisted development, daily deployments
- ❌ **Business**: Manual processes, hierarchical approvals, monthly planning cycles, email-driven workflows

**The result:** Organizational schizophrenia where the slowest process sets the tempo for the entire company. IT ships features in 2 weeks, but Marketing takes 6 weeks to approve messaging, Sales takes months to learn new pitches, and Finance can't report on new revenue streams.

**SOLID.AI solves this:** A framework for **whole-organization transformation** where ALL functions (Sales, Finance, HR, Marketing, Operations, Legal) operate at AI-native speed. When the entire organization transforms coherently:
- ⚡ **Time to market:** Months → Weeks
- 🎯 **Error rates:** 5-10% → <1%
- 📈 **Scalability:** Linear (hire more people) → Exponential (deploy more AI)
- 💰 **Overhead:** 80% busywork → 20% busywork

**See:** [Whole-Organization Transformation](09-whole-organization-transformation.md) for the full competitive case.

## Objectives

- Establish a shared language for human–AI collaboration.
- Offer reference models that teams can tailor to their own context.
- Provide governance guardrails that scale with experimentation.
- Enable continuous learning loops across strategy, delivery, and operations.

## Key Artifacts

- **Manifesto:** Anchors philosophy and roadmap.
- **Principles:** Codify ethical, human-centered decision making.
- **Architecture:** Shows how data, cognition, and automation interlock.
- **Playbooks:** Actionable guidance for squads, pools, and operations.
- **RFCs & ADRs:** Capture decisions that evolve the framework over time.

## How to Navigate the Repository

1. Start with the Manifesto for context and intent.
2. Read the numbered documents in `DOCS/` for a deep dive into each layer.
3. Explore Mermaid diagrams in `DIAGRAMS/` to visualize interactions.
4. Review RFCs and ADRs to understand how the framework evolves.
5. Apply the playbooks to bring concepts into operational practice.

## Versioning

- `main` holds stable releases of the framework.
- `dev` is the integration branch for approved RFCs.
- Manifesto updates follow semantic versioning (v1.0.0, v1.1.0, etc.).
