# Code of Conduct

solid.ai is an open, collaborative community. We expect every participant to act with integrity, empathy, and respect. This document outlines how we work together and the process for resolving issues when expectations are not met.

## Our Standards

- Support a purpose-driven culture that values human dignity and collective intelligence.
- Listen generously, disagree constructively, and assume good intent.
- Credit the work of others and cite sources for ideas, data, or code you reuse.
- Protect confidential or sensitive information; do not share data you do not own.
- Keep language inclusive and accessible; avoid harassment, intimidation, or discrimination.
- Recognize that everyone brings different experiences—welcome newcomers and mentor generously.

## Unacceptable Behavior

- Harassment, hate speech, or discriminatory language.
- Personal attacks, trolling, or deliberate disruption of discussions.
- Unauthorized disclosure of private information or confidential materials.
- Plagiarism, misrepresentation of work, or unethical use of AI-generated content.
- Any conduct that violates applicable laws or compromises community safety.

## Reporting Guidelines

If you experience or witness a violation:

1. Document the incident, including dates, people involved, and context.
2. Contact the maintainers at `conduct@solid.ai` (temporary alias) or via a private GitHub issue if email is not possible.
3. Reports will be reviewed within five business days. You will receive acknowledgement and a proposed path forward.

## Enforcement

- Maintainers will evaluate incidents fairly, respecting confidentiality whenever feasible.
- Consequences may include warnings, removal from discussions, revocation of repository access, or escalating to platform administrators.
- Repeated or severe violations can result in permanent removal from the project.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including GitHub repositories, issues, pull requests, discussions, live events, synchronous communication channels, and any interactions where the project brand or community is represented.

## Acknowledgements

We are inspired by open-source community guidelines such as the Contributor Covenant and the MLCommons Code of Conduct. solid.ai adapts these principles to emphasize purpose-driven, human–AI collaboration.
