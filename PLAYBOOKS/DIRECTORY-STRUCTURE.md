**When to read:**
- After governance is established
- Ready to deploy agents, processes, data infrastructure
- Need hands-on technical guidance

**Time investment:** 3-4 hours total

**Recommended sequence:**
1. Agents Guide (deploy first agent)
2. Process Mapping (document workflows)
3. Data Spine Structuring (build foundation)
4. Data Analytics (enable learning)
5. Agile Quality (update processes)

---

### 👥 **People & Culture** (3 playbooks)
**Purpose:** Scale humans alongside technology

**When to read:**
- Teams are adopting AI but culture isn't shifting
- Need to train organization (50%+ people)

## 🔄 Typical Reading Sequence

### **Quick Start** (If you have 2 hours)
1. Maturity Model (30 min) - Assess where you are
2. Day in the Life (30 min) - See the vision
3. Your sector playbook (45 min) - Specific to your function
4. Agents Guide (45 min) - Deploy first agent

### **Executive Overview** (If you're presenting to leadership)
1. Maturity Model (30 min)
2. Day in the Life (30 min)
3. Organizational Scalability (45 min)
4. OKRs & KPIs (30 min)

**Total:** 2 hours 15 min → Enough to build compelling case

### **Full Implementation** (If you're leading transformation)
1. **Week 1:** Foundation (all 3) + Governance (all 2) = 3.5 hours
2. **Week 2:** Implementation (all 5) = 4 hours
3. **Week 3:** People & Culture (all 3) = 2.5 hours
4. **Week 4:** Organizational (all 5) + Your sector = 3 hours
5. **Ongoing:** Reference as needed

Playbooks are heavily cross-referenced:

**Example: If you're implementing AI Agents...**
- Read: `implementation/implementing-ai-agents-practical-guide.md`
- References:
  - `governance/ai-governance-risk-assessment.md` (for risk scoring)
  - `implementation/data-spine-structuring-governance.md` (for data contracts)
  - `implementation/process-mapping-sipoc-integration.md` (for workflows)
  - `people-culture/ai-learning-development.md` (for training teams)

**Navigation tip:** Each playbook ends with "Related Playbooks" section
