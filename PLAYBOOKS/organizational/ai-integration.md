# AI Integration Playbook

Use this playbook to introduce new AI capabilities responsibly across the solid.ai ecosystem.

## Integration Stages

1. **Discovery**
   - Identify business outcomes and purpose alignment.
   - Assess data availability and ethical considerations.
2. **Design**
   - Define agent persona, guardrails, and interaction modes.
   - Draft RFC outlining scope, success metrics, and governance checkpoints.
3. **Pilot**
   - Launch in sandbox or limited production with observability hooks.
   - Gather qualitative and quantitative feedback.
4. **Scale**
   - Automate onboarding, documentation, and runbooks.
   - Update playbooks, diagrams, and training materials.

## Checklist

- [ ] Purpose statement linked to Manifesto principles.
- [ ] Data Spine contracts and lineage documented.
- [ ] Ethical risk assessment completed with the Governance Circle.
- [ ] Observability instrumentation planned and tested.
- [ ] Human overseers trained and assigned.
- [ ] Rollback plan defined and rehearsed.

## Integration Patterns

- **Co-Pilot:** Agent augments human decisions with contextual insights.
- **Auto-Resolve:** Agent executes low-risk tasks autonomously with notifications.
- **Escalation:** Agent triages and routes issues to humans with recommended next steps.

## Post-Launch

- Review performance weekly for the first month, then monthly.
- Capture lessons learned as RFC addenda or ADR updates.
- Retire or refactor agents that fail to meet purpose, ethics, or performance thresholds.
