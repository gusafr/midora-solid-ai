# Pool Playbook

Pools provide reusable capabilities, governance support, and specialized expertise to squads and automation initiatives.

## Core Responsibilities

- Curate and maintain shared assets (data products, AI models, design systems).
- Offer consultation, pairing, or embedded support to squads.
- Ensure compliance with governance and observability standards.
- Nurture continuous learning across the organization.

## Engagement Model

1. Squad submits request via shared intake board.
2. Pool lead triages, assigns specialists or agents, defines success criteria.
3. Collaborate on delivery; capture decisions in RFCs or ADRs when needed.
4. Close engagement with retrospective and knowledge share.

## Metrics

- Turnaround time for intake requests.
- Reuse rate of pool-managed assets.
- Compliance adherence across supported initiatives.
- Satisfaction scores from squads and governance circles.

## Continuous Improvement

- Maintain pool-specific playbooks and templates.
- Host quarterly capability reviews to assess tooling, skills, and capacity.
- Partner with the Governance Circle to anticipate policy changes.
