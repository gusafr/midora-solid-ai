# Squad Playbook

This playbook guides cross-functional squads delivering outcomes within the solid.ai framework.

## Mission

Deliver stakeholder value by combining human expertise with AI agents, anchored by the solid.ai principles.

## Squad Models

Squads can organize in different patterns based on outcome complexity and organizational maturity:

### Product Triad (Recommended for Lean Operations)

A **three-person core** optimized for agility and clear accountability:

| Role | Responsibilities | Can be AI Agent? |
|------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Product Owner** | Purpose alignment, stakeholder management, value prioritization | Phase 2+ |
| **System Architect** | Technical design, data contracts, AI agent orchestration | Phase 2+ |
| **Project Manager** | Execution coordination, dependencies, observability tracking | Yes (with human oversight) |

**When to use:** Fast-moving initiatives, clear scope, access to specialized pools for deeper skills.

### Extended Squad

Larger squads with embedded specialists:

- **Squad Lead:** Aligns work with purpose, manages stakeholder expectations.
- **Human Specialists:** Designers, engineers, analysts, domain experts.
- **AI Agents:** Embedded cognitive teammates providing insights or automation.
- **Ops Steward:** Ensures observability, compliance, and incident readiness.

**When to use:** Complex initiatives requiring sustained deep expertise, longer-term engagements.

## Cadence

| Frequency | Ritual | Focus |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Daily | Sync or async stand-up | Progress, blockers, agent status |
| Weekly | Outcome review | Inspect metrics, adjust backlog |
| Biweekly | Learning session | Share insights, update knowledge base |
| Monthly | Governance checkpoint | Validate adherence to RFC/ADR decisions |

## Workflow

1. Intake opportunity, validate purpose alignment, and capture in backlog.
2. Draft RFC if change extends beyond squad scope.
3. Collaborate with pools for specialized skills or data products.
4. Implement with AI agents in co-pilot or auto-resolve mode.
5. Observe outcomes, log insights, and update documentation.

## Squad-Pool Collaboration

Squads draw on **capability pools** for specialized expertise:

- **Embedded engagement:** Pool member joins squad for full sprint/cycle
- **On-demand engagement:** Pool provides time-boxed consultation or pairing
- **Self-service:** Squad consumes pool-managed assets (data products, templates, tools)

See **playbook-pools.md** for detailed pool engagement models.

## KPIs

- Outcome delivery rate vs. planned objectives.
- Quality of agent-assisted outputs (accuracy, explainability).
- Incident rate and resolution time.
- Learning contributions (RFCs, ADRs, playbook updates).
