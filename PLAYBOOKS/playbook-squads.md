# Squad Playbook

This playbook guides cross-functional squads delivering outcomes within the solid.ai framework.

## Mission

Deliver stakeholder value by combining human expertise with AI agents, anchored by the solid.ai principles.

## Roles

- **Squad Lead:** Aligns work with purpose, manages stakeholder expectations.
- **Human Specialists:** Designers, engineers, analysts, domain experts.
- **AI Agents:** Embedded cognitive teammates providing insights or automation.
- **Ops Steward:** Ensures observability, compliance, and incident readiness.

## Cadence

| Frequency | Ritual | Focus |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Daily | Sync or async stand-up | Progress, blockers, agent status |
| Weekly | Outcome review | Inspect metrics, adjust backlog |
| Biweekly | Learning session | Share insights, update knowledge base |
| Monthly | Governance checkpoint | Validate adherence to RFC/ADR decisions |

## Workflow

1. Intake opportunity, validate purpose alignment, and capture in backlog.
2. Draft RFC if change extends beyond squad scope.
3. Collaborate with pools for specialized skills or data products.
4. Implement with AI agents in co-pilot or auto-resolve mode.
5. Observe outcomes, log insights, and update documentation.

## KPIs

- Outcome delivery rate vs. planned objectives.
- Quality of agent-assisted outputs (accuracy, explainability).
- Incident rate and resolution time.
- Learning contributions (RFCs, ADRs, playbook updates).
