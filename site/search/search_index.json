decisions)\n3. **Technology Adoption:** Legacy systems (5+ year cycles) vs. Latest tools (monthly experimentation)\n4. **Data Access:** Gated (IT controls access) vs. Self-serve (business users access via BI/APIs)\n5. **Risk Tolerance:** Minimize change (99.9% uptime) vs. Experiment fast (fail fast, iterate)\n\nFor each dimension, you will score:\n- **1 = High friction** (IT and business operate completely differently)\n- **2 = Moderate friction** (some misalignment)\n- **3 = Neutral** (neither aligned nor misaligned)\n- **4 = Low friction** (mostly aligned)\n- **5 = Aligned** (IT and

Stakeholder Impact Analysis\n\n**Students (Data Subjects):**\n- **Benefits:** Better AI writing feedback (if they use the product)\n- **Harms:**\n  - Privacy: Essays may contain personal, sensitive information\n  - Consent: Students likely didn't consent to commercial AI training\n  - Future risk: De-anonymization possible; essays could be reconstructed\n  - Trust: May feel betrayed if discovered without clear consent\n\n**Teachers:**\n- **Benefits:** Improved AI tool for feedback\n- **Harms:** Ethical discomfort if students weren't fully informed\n\n**Company:**\n- **Benefits:** Competitive AI model, potential revenue\n- **Harms:** Reputational risk if this becomes public scandal\n\n**Society:**\n- **Benefits:** Better educational AI tools (if shared broadly)\n- **Harms:** Normalizes data extraction from vulnerable populations (students)\n\n## 2. Values Alignment Check\n\n\u274c **Mission Alignment:** If your mission is \"empowering learners,\" using their data without clear consent contradicts this.\n\n\u274c **Public Defensibility:** \"We used student essays to build our AI\" would likely cause backlash.\n\n\u274c **Treating as Ends:** Students become means to your commercial AI, not ends in themselves.\n\n## 3. Transparency &amp; Explainability\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f **Current State:** Students likely unaware their essays could be used this way.\n\n\u274c **Full Transparency:** Would require: \"Your essays will train our commercial AI, which may be used by others.\"\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f **Media Risk:** HIGH - \"EdTech Company Uses Student Essays to Train AI\" is a bad headline.\n\n## 4. Fairness &amp; Bias\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f **Bias Risk:** Student essays reflect demographic, linguistic, and educational privilege. Training on this data may:\n- Favor certain writing styles or dialects\n- Disadvantage non-native speakers or neurodiverse writers\n- Encode existing educational inequalities\n\n## 5. Privacy &amp; Consent\n\n\u274c **Consent:** Likely missing or insufficient. Students consented to submit essays for grading, not AI training.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f **Anonymization Limits:** Even anonymized text can be re-identified through writing style, topic, or metadata.\n\n\u274c **Proportionality:** Using student data for commercial AI training is disproportionate to original purpose (education).\n\n## 6. Accountability &amp; Oversight\n\n\u2753 **Who's Accountable:** If student is harmed (e.g., essay leaked, bias perpetuated), who takes responsibility?\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f **Human Oversight:** Who ensures data use remains ethical over time?\n\n## 7. Long-Term Consequences\n\n\u274c **Precedent:** Sets expectation that student data is extractable for profit.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f **Misuse:** Trained model could be sold or licensed in ways students didn't anticipate.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f **Scale Effects:** Normalizes surveillance capitalism in education.\n\n## 8.

|\n|--------|----------------------|--------------------------------|\n| **Response time** | 1-2 hours (business hours only) | &lt;5 minutes (24/7) |\n| **Lead capacity** | 50 leads/day | 500+

**Escalation rate** | 10% (SDR unsure when to escalate) | 5% (clear rules programmed) |\n| **Availability** | 40 hours/week (M-F, 9-5) | 168 hours/week (24/7) |\n\n**When to use AI:** High-volume, inbound leads (50+ per day), standard qualification criteria\n**When to use human SDR:** Complex qualification (enterprise, custom use cases), relationship-building (warm intros, referrals)\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcc8 \"Career Path\" (AI Agent Upgrade Path)\n\n### **Current Level:** Low-Level (LeadQualifier-Agent)\n\n### **Path to Intermediate-Level (LeadStrategist-Agent):**\n\n**Upgrade when:**\n- [ ] LeadQualifier-Agent handles &gt;80% of leads autonomously for 3+ months\n- [ ] Escalation rate &lt;5% (AI rarely confused, follows rules correctly)\n- [ ] Team wants more strategic insights (not just qualification, but \"Which lead sources convert best?\")\n\n**Intermediate-Level capabilities:**\n- Analyze lead patterns (which industries, company sizes, pain points convert to customers?)\n- Recommend targeting experiments (\"We should run LinkedIn ads for HR managers at 50-200 employee companies\")\n- A/B test messaging (try 3 email subject lines, identify winner)\n- Calculate LTV:CAC by lead source (which channels are profitable?)\n\n**Cost:** $1,500/month (vs. $300 for Low-Level)\n\n**When to upgrade:** After 6-12 months of Low-Level success (proven AI qualification works, now add strategy)\n\n---\n\n### **Path to High-Level:**\n\n**Not yet available (as of 2025):**\n- AI cannot set sales strategy (e.g., \"Should we expand to Enterprise?\")\n- AI cannot hire sales team\n- AI cannot manage customer relationships (strategic deals require human empathy, negotiation)\n\n**Likely timeline:** 3-5 years (2028-2030) before High-Level sales AI agents available\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udd16 AI Agent Definition (YAML)\n\n```yaml\nagent:\n  name: LeadQualifier-Agent\n  level: Low-Level\n  type: Assistant\n
