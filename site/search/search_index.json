Add \"Definition of Ready\" Policy for QA Column**\n- Rationale: 30% of items returned from QA due to incomplete test cases\n- Proposed policy: \"Item cannot enter QA unless automated tests written + passing in Dev\"\n- Impact: -30% rework rate, -15% cycle time\n- **Recommendation:** Product Owner approves + implement immediately\n\n**4.

This ensures:\n- No duplication (each service has one owning squad)\n- Clear boundaries (services have well-defined inputs/outputs via data contracts)\n- Autonomous operation (squads deliver end-to-end without constant handoffs)\n- Scalable growth (new squads = new services, not reorganizing existing ones)\n\n**Example Business Services:**\n- Customer Onboarding (not \"Frontend Squad\")\n- Fraud Detection (not \"ML Platform Team\")\n- Invoice Processing (not \"Finance Automation\")\n\n**See:** [Organizational Model](organizational-model.md), [Squad Playbook](playbooks/organizational/squads.md)\n\n### Layer 6: Governance &amp; Ethics Layer\n\n**Function:** Ensures compliance, accountability, transparency, and trust  \n**Biological Analogy:** Immune System\n\n**Governance Pillars:**\n1. **Cognitive Transparency:** All AI-driven decisions must be explainable\n2. **Human Curatorship:** Human oversight remains the moral compass\n3. **System Observability:** Everything measurable should be observable\n4. **Continuous Feedback:** Learning is the only KPI that never expires\n5. **Modular Independence:** Every layer can evolve without systemic collapse\n\n**Oversight Structures:**\n- **Governance Circle:** Multi-disciplinary board evaluating RFCs touching ethics/compliance\n- **Ethics Review:** Lightweight checklist embedded in PR templates\n- **Incident Response:** Runbooks for AI/automation incidents with notification protocols\n\n**Ethical Risk Assessment:**\n- Evaluate bias, drift, harm potential before deployment\n- Rate impact severity and required mitigation steps\n- Reassess regularly or after material changes\n\n**See:** [Governance &amp; Ethics](governance-ethics.md)\n\n&lt;div style=\"height: 2px; background: linear-gradient(to right, transparent, #0d9488, transparent); margin: 3rem 0;\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n## \ud83d\udcda Layers\n\n### Detailed Layer Specifications\n\n#### Purpose Layer: Strategic Intent\n\n**Objective:** Ensure all organizational activities trace back to human-centered purpose.\n\n**Key Artifacts:**\n- **Manifesto:** Philosophical foundation and roadmap ([solid.ai Manifesto v1.0](manifesto/solid-ai-manifesto-v1.md))\n- **OKRs (Objectives &amp; Key Results):** Quarterly strategic goals cascading from executive to squad level\n- **Ethical Policies:** Non-negotiable principles (e.g., \"No automated layoffs\", \"Transparency by default\")\n- **RFCs (Request for Comments):** Proposals for material changes to architecture or governance\n\n**Implementation:**\n- Every AI agent must cite purpose statement from Purpose Layer\n- Every automation must map to OKR or strategic objective\n- Governance Circle reviews all High/Executive-Level AI agents quarterly\n\n#### Data Spine: Unified Data Foundation\n\n**Objective:** Provide unified, governed, observable data access across the organization.\n\n**Required Components:**\n1. **Data Contracts:** Schema + SLA + versioning + ownership\n2. **Data Catalog:** Searchable metadata registry (tools: Amundsen, DataHub, Collibra)\n3. **Event Bus:** Asynchronous event streaming (tools: Kafka, AWS EventBridge, Azure Event Grid)\n4. **Lineage Tracking:** Where data originates, how it transforms, where it flows\n5. **Quality Monitoring:** Automated validation, anomaly detection, SLA alerts\n6. **Governance Layer:** Classification (PII, sensitive), retention, access controls, audit logging\n\n**Business Service Integration:**\nEvery squad must:\n- Publish domain events with data contracts\n- Document event ownership and stakeholders (consumers)\n- Enforce breaking change policy (RFC + 90-day migration)\n- Classify data (PII, sensitive, public)\n- Define retention policies (GDPR, SOX, HIPAA)\n- Enable access controls (RBAC)\n- Configure audit logging\n\n**Example Data Contract:**\n```yaml\ncontract:\n  name: OrderPlaced\n  version: v2.1.0\n  owner: Order Fulfillment Squad\n  schema:\n    order_id: string (UUID)\n    customer_id: string (UUID)\n    items: array[OrderItem]\n    total_amount: decimal(10,2)\n    currency: string (ISO 4217)\n    timestamp: datetime (ISO 8601)\n  sla:\n    latency: &lt;500ms (p95)\n    availability: 99.9%\n    freshness: real-time\n  classification: PII (customer_id)\n  retention: 7 years (financial compliance)\n  consumers:\n    - Inventory Management Squad\n    - Payment Processing Squad\n    - Analytics Squad\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"technical-reference/#cognitive-layer-ai-agent-specifications","title":"Cognitive Layer: AI Agent Specifications","text":"<p>Objective: Deploy AI agents as accountable organizational members with defined roles and oversight.</p> <p>Agent Identity Template: <pre><code>agent:\n  name: FraudDetector-Agent\n  role: Specialist (High-Level)\n  mission: Detect fraudulent transactions in real-time\n  capabilities:\n    - Analyze 10,000 transactions/minute\n    - Score risk 0-100 based on 50+ signals\n    - Auto-block transactions &gt;95 risk score\n    - Escalate 80-95 scores to human review\n  guardrails:\n    - Do not block transactions &lt;$50 (low fraud risk)\n    - Do not override human approval decisions\n    - Require human review for VIP customers\n    - Escalate if false positive rate &gt;2%\n  oversight:\n    human_steward: Risk Manager (Jane Doe)\n    review_frequency: Quarterly\n    autonomy_level: Automated (95% autonomous)\n  metrics:\n    detection_rate: &gt;98%\n    false_positive_rate: &lt;2%\n    latency: &lt;200ms (p95)\n</code></pre></p> <p>Role Hierarchy (Humans &amp;

Start transformation in Finance (safe, high ROI), then expand. Don't start in IT (would fail).\"\n- **To CTO:** \"We're not sidelining IT \u2014 we're building proof points in Finance first, then bringing IT in Phase 3 (with budget, executive support, proven AI patterns).\"\n- **To CFO/VP Sales/VP HR:** \"You get to pilot AI first (Finance, Sales, HR).

Stakeholder Impact Analysis\n\n**Students (Data Subjects):**\n- **Benefits:** Better AI writing feedback (if they use the product)\n- **Harms:**\n  - Privacy: Essays may contain personal, sensitive information\n  - Consent: Students likely didn't consent to commercial AI training\n  - Future risk: De-anonymization possible; essays could be reconstructed\n  - Trust: May feel betrayed if discovered without clear consent\n\n**Teachers:**\n- **Benefits:** Improved AI tool for feedback\n- **Harms:** Ethical discomfort if students weren't fully informed\n\n**Company:**\n- **Benefits:** Competitive AI model, potential revenue\n- **Harms:** Reputational risk if this becomes public scandal\n\n**Society:**\n- **Benefits:** Better educational AI tools (if shared broadly)\n- **Harms:** Normalizes data extraction from vulnerable populations (students)\n\n## 2. Values Alignment Check\n\n\u274c **Mission Alignment:** If your mission is \"empowering learners,\" using their data without clear consent contradicts this.\n\n\u274c **Public Defensibility:** \"We used student essays to build our AI\" would likely cause backlash.\n\n\u274c **Treating as Ends:** Students become means to your commercial AI, not ends in themselves.\n\n## 3. Transparency &amp; Explainability\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f **Current State:** Students likely unaware their essays could be used this way.\n\n\u274c **Full Transparency:** Would require: \"Your essays will train our commercial AI, which may be used by others.\"\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f **Media Risk:** HIGH - \"EdTech Company Uses Student Essays to Train AI\" is a bad headline.\n\n## 4. Fairness &amp; Bias\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f **Bias Risk:** Student essays reflect demographic, linguistic, and educational privilege. Training on this data may:\n- Favor certain writing styles or dialects\n- Disadvantage non-native speakers or neurodiverse writers\n- Encode existing educational inequalities\n\n## 5. Privacy &amp; Consent\n\n\u274c **Consent:** Likely missing or insufficient. Students consented to submit essays for grading, not AI training.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f **Anonymization Limits:** Even anonymized text can be re-identified through writing style, topic, or metadata.\n\n\u274c **Proportionality:** Using student data for commercial AI training is disproportionate to original purpose (education).\n\n## 6. Accountability &amp; Oversight\n\n\u2753 **Who's Accountable:** If student is harmed (e.g., essay leaked, bias perpetuated), who takes responsibility?\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f **Human Oversight:** Who ensures data use remains ethical over time?\n\n## 7. Long-Term Consequences\n\n\u274c **Precedent:** Sets expectation that student data is extractable for profit.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f **Misuse:** Trained model could be sold or licensed in ways students didn't anticipate.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f **Scale Effects:** Normalizes surveillance capitalism in education.\n\n## 8.

referrals)\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcc8 \"Career Path\" (AI Agent Upgrade Path)\n\n### **Current Level:** Low-Level (LeadQualifier-Agent)\n\n### **Path to Intermediate-Level (LeadStrategist-Agent):**\n\n**Upgrade when:**\n- [ ] LeadQualifier-Agent handles &gt;80% of leads autonomously for 3+ months\n- [ ] Escalation rate &lt;5% (AI rarely confused, follows rules correctly)\n- [ ] Team wants more strategic insights (not just qualification, but \"Which lead sources convert best?\")\n\n**Intermediate-Level capabilities:**\n- Analyze lead patterns (which industries, company sizes, pain points convert to customers?)\n- Recommend targeting experiments (\"We should run LinkedIn ads for HR managers at 50-200 employee companies\")\n- A/B test messaging (try 3 email subject lines, identify winner)\n- Calculate LTV:CAC by lead source (which channels are profitable?)\n\n**Cost:** $1,500/month (vs. $300 for Low-Level)\n\n**When to upgrade:** After 6-12 months of Low-Level success (proven AI qualification works, now add strategy)\n\n---\n\n### **Path to High-Level:**\n\n**Not yet available (as of 2025):**\n- AI cannot set sales strategy (e.g., \"Should we expand to Enterprise?\")\n- AI cannot hire sales team\n- AI cannot manage customer relationships (strategic deals require human empathy, negotiation)\n\n**Likely timeline:** 3-5 years

BIAS &amp; FAIRNESS ANALYSIS\n\n### 3.1 Protected Attributes\nprotected_attributes: [gender, race, age, disability_status, veteran_status]\ndata_contains_protected_attributes: false (intentionally excluded)\nproxy_attributes_risk: high (university name, zip code correlate with race/income)\n\n### 3.2 Training Data Bias\ntraining_data_source: \"10,000 historical resumes (2020-2025)\"\nbias_in_training_data:\n  - Historical hiring was 70% male, 30% female (company was biased)\n  - Historical hiring favored Ivy League schools (socioeconomic bias)\n  - Resumes from certain zip codes overrepresented\n\nmitigation_applied:\n  - Re-balanced dataset (50/50 male/female)\n  - Downweighted university name as feature\n  - Tested for disparate impact before deployment\n\n### 3.3 Disparate Impact Testing\ntest_dataset: \"1,000 resumes (500 male, 500 female)\"\nresults:\n  - Male approval rate: 22% (110/500)\n  - Female approval rate: 20% (100/500)\n  - Disparate impact ratio: 1.1 (within acceptable threshold of 1.2)\n\nbias_mitigation_status: \u2705 PASS (no significant bias detected)\n\n## 4. TRANSPARENCY &amp; EXPLAINABILITY\n\n### 4.1 Can AI explain its decisions?\nexplainability: yes\nexplanation_format: \"Resume scored 78/100 because:\n  - 5 years experience in Python (requirement: 3+)\n  - Led 2 teams (requirement: leadership experience)\n  - Worked at Fortune 500 company (relevant experience)\n  - Missing: ML certification (preferred but not required)\"\n\n### 4.2 Can applicants challenge decisions?\nappeal_process: yes\nprocess: \"Applicants can request human review via careers@company.com\"\nhuman_review_rate: \"100% of rejected applicants reviewed by recruiter\"\n\n## 5.

SAFETY &amp; SECURITY\n\n### 7.1 Worst-Case Scenario\nworst_case: \"Biased AI systematically rejects qualified women/minorities \u2192 Discrimination lawsuit ($1M+ settlement + reputational damage)\"\n\n### 7.2 Guardrails\nprohibited_actions:\n  - \"Do NOT auto-reject applicants (human reviews all)\"\n  - \"Do NOT use protected attributes in scoring\"\n\nboundary_conditions:\n  - \"If disparate impact ratio &gt;1.2, pause and alert Legal\"\n  - \"If override rate &gt;25%, retrain model (AI not aligned with human judgment)\"\n\nfail_safe:\n  - \"If bias detected, revert to manual resume review\"\n\n### 7.3 Security\nadversarial_risk: low (applicants can't easily game the system)\nsecurity_review: \u2705 Completed (no PII exposed, access controlled)\n\n## 8. COMPLIANCE &amp; LEGAL\n\n### 8.1 Applicable Regulations\nregulations: [EEOC (US), GDPR (EU), CCPA (CA)]\nlegal_review: \u2705 Completed (Nov 1, 2025 - Mark Lee, General Counsel)\n\n### 8.2 Certifications\nrequired_certifications: none\naudit_schedule: Annual EEOC self-audit\n\n## 9.

Pick one high-value use case (churn prediction, agent performance) 2. Build MVP analytics pipeline (2-4 weeks) 3. Implement learning loop (weekly retraining) 4.
